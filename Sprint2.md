# Sprint <2>: 2019-11-27 to 2019-12-3

## overview
* Our second sprint was dedicated to improving the organisation, communication within the team and  setting more feasible targets. 
* A few details of the functionality of the game were not complete in the first sprint and were set as a priority for the second sprint in addition to developing a second moving character to chase the player.
* The sprint was successful as all objectives were achieved
* Overall, organisation was improved in this sprint, our backlog on Trello became clear showing the objectives for previous and upcoming sprints. 

## review
* Neatening up coding standards, especially commenting 
* Much better communication via slack on code channel 
* did not have distinctive pair programming session but nonetheless did pair programming after meetings as issue arose 
* As Individuals all reviewed sections of code and then brought it together 
* No unit testing carried out 
* Functional testing done a bit as creating game, but not formally 
* No formal meetings, continuous slack conversations 
* Each sprint is getting better and more organised 
* Game Performance problem - Speed of character slows down - needs looking at in sprint 3, only happens on retina screens so far

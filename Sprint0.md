# Sprint <0>: 2019-11-18 to 2019-11-25

## overview
* Sprint zero can be described as building the foundation for our game. 
* The focus of the first two weeks was to informally brainstorm and establish roles within the group, with the use of a skills matrix resources/images/Skills matrix.jpeg
* The organisation of the group rapidly improved once the development team and scrum master were established, meetings became more frequent and well organised with objectives of each meeting set beforehand.

## review of sprint 0 
* In a sprint review meeting on 18th November, we expressed our thoughts on the progress made in the sprint and how we thought we could improve. 
* We agreed to continue Scrum meetings, organise our Trello backlogs and ensure our objectives are all up to date. 
* We ranked the features of our game from high priority to low priority to help set objectives for sprint 1. 
* The features we found of greatest importance were the timer(user story 5, version 2) , as it determines a players score upon completing the game, the leaderboard (user story 7, version 2) and a start button.

## meeting 1 <18/11/19>
* Present our two game ideas to the customer 
* Two game ideas presented; an escape room and a maze game 
* Customer expressed concern for the playability of game 1 and a lack of originality of game 2

## meeting 2 <06/11/19>
* Present our revised second game idea 
* Presented the story line behind game 2 and details of the game 
* Customer discussed how we would increase the difficulty of the game and if there are any positive elements to the game 
* As a result we considered the positive response (keys in 4 pieces) for our revised idea and prioritising the customers’ request for a partial prototype. A meeting on how to best code the first steps was arranged.

## meeting 1 <13/11/19>
* Present our moving character and basic maze 
* Customer was pleased with the basic prototype and stressed a need to continue to develop the functionality of the game
* We were pleased with the client's response to our first prototype and finalisation of the core idea of the game.
* This led us to start planning the first official sprint to develop the core functionality of the game.

## meeting 1 <20/11/19>

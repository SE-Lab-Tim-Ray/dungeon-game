# Sprint <3>: 2019-12-04 to 2019-12-12

## overview
* Sprint 3 concluded the development of our dungeon game
* We set objectives for the sprint on 4th of december, by discussing the progress made thus far and discussing the feasibility of each task on the sprint 3 and sprint 4 backlog( section 4.1.3 of the Team Brown Sprint Documentation PDF (resources/Documentation/Team Brown Sprint Documentation.pdf)) . 
* We decided the appearing walls were crucial to increase the difficulty of the game(resources/images/Maze with appearing walls and rats.png) and the collection of keys would increase the playability of our game. 
* Overall, the objectives set for the sprint were optimistic as we did not consider the impact of other deadlines on the feasibility of each task. 
* Both Hajar and Geetha struggled with deadlines from other units( due to health issues) and resulted to requesting an extension on other units. 
* On the other hand, the improvement of  the user interface design was apparent by the end of sprint 3

## review
* the entire development process, we found researching and evaluating the feasibility of each task crucial to ensuring an on time delivery of the product and aligning customer needs to the final product.
* The end product of our process was a fairly difficult, yet, playable maze with a leaderboard, graphics and moving characters.
* Pleased with the development of our game and our use of scrum techniques such as the use of sprints, sprint reviews and  scrum meetings.
* Our communication as a group improved through the sprints, discussions became focused and organised on slack.
* We adopted the agile technique of beginning with a simple functioning game and developing its’ quality with time, this technique allowed the technical progression of the development team
